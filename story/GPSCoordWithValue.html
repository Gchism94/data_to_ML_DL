by a set of geographic coordinates that have an associated numeric
value.<br><br>It considers the population of 925 cities in the UK. This
example dataset is provided in the <a

available on this <a

<h1>Bubble map</h1>
<hr />
<p>The go-to graphic in this kind of situation is probably the <a
href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/bubblemap.html">bubble map</a>.
Basically, one circle is drawn per provided geographic position. The
size of the bubble is proportional to its corresponding numeric value.
Warning, remember that the bubble area must be proportional to the
value, <a

radius</a>.</p>
